·:·:· Product Information ·:·:·


▶ I haven’t bought the game yet, but it looks great! What is it about? How does it play?
<answer>
Stone Story is a mixture of RPG and incremental/idle gameplay (e.g. Cookie Clicker, Candy Box). You don’t control the character directly; instead, you manage equipment to adjust to the enemies and challenges you face.

The beginning of Stone Story can be thought of as a puzzle game. As you progress it transitions to a more incremental/idle play style as you collect more loot to tackle harder challenges. However, it still maintains puzzle and RPG mechanics as you work out better solutions to previous challenges and tackle harder difficulty challenges.
</answer>

▶ What is an incremental/idle game?
<answer>
Incremental and idle games focus on long term building of strength and/or resources, largely through hands-off gameplay. Incremental mechanics typically involve leaving the game alone for a few hours and coming back to manage your gains in order to improve the speed/efficiency of gaining even more stats and resources.

In Stone Story, incremental gameplay is best exemplified with loot farming. You can leave SSRPG alone to horde equipment drops and fuse them together to craft even stronger gear.
</answer>

▶ How long is the game?
<answer>
The main storyline takes about 6-8 hours. Beyond that, there are higher difficulties to unlock and more loot to horde!
</answer>

▶ What's the end-game got to offer me?
<answer>
At the moment, after you beat the main story arc you'll unlock higher difficulty versions of all the areas. These will offer progressively harder challenges, forcing you to adapt your play style and improve your gear. 
  
New content is actively being worked on and will add even more to the end-game as it releases.
</answer>

▶ Is there a mobile/Switch version?
<answer>
Currently not. However, both mobile and Switch versions are planned for 2020.

  5. Repeat the last two steps until you’ve recovered a viable save.
  6. Help improve the game by reporting the issue in the <a href="https://discord.gg/StoneStoryRPG" target="_blank">SSRPG Discord</a>. Tell us what happened!
</answer>

▶ How do I access the beta?
<answer>

  1. Close Stone Story
  2. In your Steam library, right-click "Stone Story RPG" then select "Properties"
  3. Select the "Betas" tab

▶ What’s the best set of weapons?
<answer>
Stone Story RPG has a strong focus on using the right weapons for the right job. As you progress, you’ll have different priorities that dictate which equipment best solves your needs at the time.
</answer>

▶ No, for real though, what are the best weapons?
<answer>
Big Swords are effective against mobs and Small Swords have the highest DPS, while Shields and Hammers are great for stacking up armor.
</answer>

▶ What are Æther and Vigor? What are these symbols on my gear?
<answer>
There are 5 elements in the game: Poison (∞), Vigor (♥), Æther (*), Fire (φ) and Ice (❄).
  
Most enemies have an element associated with them. You can use the Sight Stone’s equipped ability to inspect enemies and learn about their type and weakness. Elements will also provide unique bonuses to your gear, depending on how they're used. Experiment with the crafting to find out!
</answer>

▶ What does Unmake mean?
<answer>
To be Unmade is to evaporate into pure Ki. Some Æther weapons have a special ability that can instantly Unmake foes. This usually does not work on bosses.
  
Usually.
</answer>

▶ How do I get more wands? / How do I get more [element] runes?
<answer>
Each area has an element associated with it, which causes that element's rune to drop.
  Poison (∞) in the Caves of Fear and the Temple
  Vigor  (♥) in the Mushroom Forest
  Æther  (*) in the Haunted Halls
  Fire   (φ) in the Bronze Mines
  Ice    (❄) in the Icy Ridge
The final boss can drop any of the elemental runes.

The exception to this is Deadwood Canyon; instead of runes, it drops increased amounts of basic equipment (especially Wands).
</answer>

▶ Is there a faster way to craft stuff? Getting past 5☆ takes too long.
<answer>
The best way to craft higher star equipment is to combine the base items up to the star level you want, then fuse those into the final item you want.

Example:    
  Sword + 63 Swords = 6☆ Sword
  Wand + 63 Wands = 6☆ Wand
  6☆ Sword + 6☆ Wand = 6☆ Stone Sword 
</answer>

▶ Why did the effect of my equipment change when I upgraded it?
<answer>
When fusing two runed items of different suffixes, the suffix of the item on the left becomes the suffix of the resulting item.
 ☆ Vigor Shield ☆ (ah) + ☆ Vigor Shield ☆ (A) = ☆☆ Vigor Shield ☆☆ (ah)
 ☆ Vigor Shield ☆ (A) + ☆ Vigor Shield ☆ (ah) = ☆☆ Vigor Shield ☆☆ (A)
</answer>

▶ How do I determine which rune suffix I get when crafting items?
<answer>
When crafting a rune with a stone item, the side the rune is on determines the suffix the resulting item is given. 
  If the rune is on the left it will have a minor bonus to armor or damage and a special effect based on the element of the rune.
  If the rune is on the right it will be given a large, singular bonus to armor or damage against foes weak to the element of the rune.
  
For example when a Vigor rune is fused into a Stone Shield, if the rune is on the left it'll be given the suffix (ah); if it's on the right it'll be (A).
  ☆ Vigor Rune ☆ + ☆ Stone Shield ☆ = ☆ Vigor Shield ☆ (ah)
  ☆ Stone Shield ☆ + ☆ Vigor Rune ☆ = ☆ Vigor Shield ☆ (A)

A notable exception to this is when crafting either a Staff or a Hammer. 
The Staff and Hammer have 6 potential suffixes. As a result, the crafting of these items is somewhat less predictable. If you don’t get the suffix you wanted when crafting, it is recommended to use the Mutate workstation to change it.
</answer>

▶ What does the Quest Stone do? 
<answer>
The Quest Stone is not yet fully implemented. It’s planned to allow user-generated side-quests. 

In the meantime, it’s just a good way to supplement the passive armor generation of shields, as it can be equipped on either hand.
</answer>

▶ What does the Mutate workstation do?
<answer>
Mutating items changes something about them.
  
A weapon with a rune slotted changes which suffix it has (ex. dP > D).
A base weapon like a sword will turn into another base item (ex. a Wand into a Shield).
A rune on its own, not slotted into anything, will turn into another type of rune (ex. Poison(∞) > Ice(❄)).

The result from the mutation is randomized.

▶ What is Stonescript?
<answer>
Stonescript is an optional, late-game addition that unlocks when you find the Mind Stone.

It allows you to write scripts that further automate your character (ex. having them drink potions if your health gets low). The most common use is to change weapons based on current conditions in the game. For example, when you face a specific boss you can automatically equip the best gear against it.

Stonescript also allows you to overlay custom ASCII art over the game; in a word, cosmetics. Maybe Pallas needs a hat or Bolesh needs some booties? That's up to you!

Version 3.0 of the game will expand Stone Story with a broad range of new functionality that allows players to get extra creative.
</answer>

▶ Programming? That sounds hard…
<answer>
Not to worry, Stonescript is for programmers of all expertise! Whether you're just starting out or a seasoned coder, Stonescript offers a wide variety of features that can help you bring your game to the next level.  

Strictly speaking, Stonescript is optional (though recommended). There is nothing stopping you from beating the game without it. However, if you are interested in giving it a go the SSRPG 
  community is full of helpful people willing to lend a hand. Got a script idea? Need to iron out some kinks in your code? We'll be more than happy to help!

▶ What is Acropolis? Is there a way to get there?
<answer>
Acropolis is the home of the ascended. Not much is known about Acropolis at this time. However, it is the next destination of a certain intrepid stone person...
</answer>

▶ What is the green stream on the bridge? Can I open the chest?
<answer>
That's the Stream of the Silent. Said to extend all the way into Acropolis, few know how it was created or what sustains it.

Perhaps in the future you might be able to reach the chest or Acropolis itself.

▶ Where can I learn more about the game?
<answer>
The Discord server is currently the best place to find information about the game. The devs and mods are always available and happy to answer any specific questions you might have. You can use Discord's search function to see if others have asked about what you’re looking for.

Several important pieces of information have been pinned for ease of discovery (particularly in #theorycraft).

If you need help, don't be afraid to jump on our Discord and just ask! The server is quite active and there’s usually someone willing to help.
  
There is a Stone Story RPG wiki, but it's currently being worked on by members of our community. If you'd like to help out, we always welcome more contributors.

▶ The game plays/sounds great; who do I thank?
<answer>
The lead developer is Gabriel Santos (@standardcombo), with audio design by Rafael Langoni Smith (@LangoniSmith). 
  
Many other talented developers have also contributed to the project. Check the game’s credits to see the full list!
</answer>

▶ Is there anything I can do to help?
<answer>
The biggest way you can help Stone Story RPG is to spread the word about it. We're a small team and -completely- independent, meaning we're not attached to any publisher. This allows us to retain total creative control over the project and make the game that both we and our community want. 
  
However, as you might imagine, this means we're spread fairly thin! We don't have the benefit of a large marketing budget. If you share Stone Story RPG and get people talking about the game (especially streamers and YouTubers), that would help immensely towards the long-term health of the game and community.   

For something more hands-on with the project, the Discord server is a great place for you to be. By taking part in active discussion with suggestions and bug reports, you help to refine the game and create a better experience for other fans.

Stone Story RPG would not be where it is right now were it not for the generous support of players like you.

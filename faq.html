<font color="#bbbbbb">
I haven’t bought the game yet, but it looks great, what is it about?/how does it play?

<f>Stone Story is a mixture of RPG and incremental/idle gameplay (e.g. Cookie Clicker, Candy Box). 
You don’t control the character directly; instead, you manage equipment to adjust to the enemies and challenges you face.

The beginning of Stone Story can be thought of as a puzzle game. 
As you progress it transitions to a more incremental/idle play style as you collect more loot to tackle harder challenges. 
However, it still maintains puzzle/RPG mechanics as you work out better solutions to previous challenges and tackle harder difficulties.</f>

═══════════════════════════════SS═══════════════════════════════

How long is the game?

The main storyline takes about 6-8 hours. Beyond that, there are higher difficulties to unlock and more loot to horde!

═══════════════════════════════SS═══════════════════════════════

Is there a mobile/Switch version?

Currently not. However, both mobile and Switch versions are planned for 2020.

What are the game’s shortcut keys?

I – Inventory
Q – Drink Potion 
R – Activate equipped weapon’s special attack
M – Edit the Mindstone script

Windows: C:/Users/userName/AppData/LocalLow/Martian Rex, Inc_/Stone Story/<steam id>/primary_save.txt
MacOS: ~/Library/Application Support/Martian Rex, Inc_/Stone Story/<steam id>/primary_save.txt
Linux: <your steam install location for SSRPG>/saves/<steam id>/primary_save.txt

═══════════════════════════════SS═══════════════════════════════

How do I access the beta?

What’s the best set of weapons?

SSRPG has a strong focus on using the right weapons for the right job. 
As you progress you’ll have different priorities that dictate which equipment best solves your needs at the time.
═══════════════════════════════SS═══════════════════════════════

No, for real though, what are the best weapons?

Big swords are effective against mobs and small swords have the highest DPS, while shields and hammers are great for stacking up armor.

═══════════════════════════════SS═══════════════════════════════

What’s an Æther foe?

Æther is an element. 
There are 5 elements in the game: Poison (∞), Vigor (♥), Æther (*), Fire (φ) and Ice (❄). 
Most enemies have an element associated with them and you can use the Sight Stone’s equipped ability to inspect enemies and learn about their type and weakness.

═══════════════════════════════SS═══════════════════════════════

What does Unmake mean?

To be unmade is to evaporate into pure Ki. 
Some Æther weapons have a special ability that can instantly unmake foes. 
This usually does not work on bosses.

═══════════════════════════════SS═══════════════════════════════

Is there a faster way to craft stuff? Getting past 5☆ takes too long.
The best way to craft higher star equipment is to combine the base items up to the star level you want and then fuse those into the final item you want.

Example: 	
sword + 63 swords = 6☆ sword
	wand + 63 wands = 6☆ wand
	6☆ sword + 6☆ wand = 6☆ stone sword 
	
═══════════════════════════════SS═══════════════════════════════

What does the Quest Stone do? 
The Quest Stone isn’t fully implemented yet. It’s planned to allow user generated side-quests. 
In the meantime, it’s just a good way to supplement the passive armor generation of shields, as it can be equipped on either hand.

═══════════════════════════════SS═══════════════════════════════

What does mutate do?

Mutating items changes something about them.
A weapon with a rune slotted changes which suffix it has, dP > D for example.
A base weapon like a sword will turn into another base item, E.G.  a wand into a shield.
A rune on its own, not slotted into anything, will turn into another type of rune. poison(∞) > ice(❄). etc.

The result from the mutation is randomised

What is Stonescript?

Stonescript is an optional, late-game addition that unlocks when you find the Mind Stone. 
It allows you to write scripts that further automate your character, such as drinking potions if your health gets low. 
The most common use is to change weapons based on changing conditions in the game. 
For example, when you face a specific boss you can automatically equip the best gear against it. 
It also allows you to overlay custom ASCII art over the game (cosmetics). Maybe Pallas needs a hat or Bolesh needs some booties? 
Version 3.0 of the game expands Stone Story with a broad range of new functionality that allows players to get extra creative.

═══════════════════════════════SS═══════════════════════════════

Programming? That sounds hard…

Strictly speaking, Stonescript is optional, though recommended. 
There is nothing stopping you from beating the game without it. 
However, if you are interested in giving it a go there are a bunch of helpful people willing to lend a hand over on the SSRPG Discord Server. 
[ https://discord.gg/StoneStoryRPG ]

═══════════════════════════════SS═══════════════════════════════

What are some good starting tips for Stonescript?

Hold Tab for more information in-level.
‘foe = boss’ is a good catch all for the bosses.
Check out http://stonestoryrpg.com/stonescript/help.txt for a comprehensive documentation of implemented Stonescript features.
you can also browse the Discord’s #stonescript channel and ask questions there if you get stuck.

What is Acropolis? Is there a way to get there?

Acropolis is the home of the ascended. 
Not much is known about Acropolis at this time. 
However, it is the next destination of a certain intrepid stone person.

═══════════════════════════════SS═══════════════════════════════

What is the green stream on the bridge? can i open the chest?

Stream of the Silent. Said to make its way all the way into Acropolis, few know how it was created or what sustains it.
The chest is decoration and is not obtainable at this time.

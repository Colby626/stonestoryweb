·:·:· Product Information ·:·:·


▶ I haven’t bought the game yet, but it looks great, what is it about? How does it play?
<answer>
Stone Story is a mixture of RPG and incremental/idle gameplay (e.g. Cookie Clicker, Candy Box). 
You don’t control the character directly; instead, you manage equipment to adjust to the enemies and challenges you face.

The beginning of Stone Story can be thought of as a puzzle game. 
As you progress it transitions to a more incremental/idle play style as you collect more loot to tackle harder challenges. 
However, it still maintains puzzle/RPG mechanics as you work out better solutions to previous challenges and tackle harder difficulties.
</answer>

▶ What is an incremental/idle game?
<answer>
An incremental games are games that focus around long term building of strength and/or resources though mostly hands off gameplay. 
Leave it for a few hours and come back to manage your gains to improve the speed/efficiency of gaining even more stats.

In SSRPG in particular this is exemplified in the gathering and fusing of like equipment into stronger versions of themselves and the condensing of enchantments.
</answer>

▶ How long is the game?
<answer>
The main storyline takes about 6-8 hours. Beyond that, there are higher difficulties to unlock and more loot to horde!
</answer>

▶ What's the end game got to offer me?
<answer>
At the moment after you beat the main story arc you'll likely not have beaten all of the levels at their highest difficulties, so that's unusually the next step for people. 
This will take a lot more time than the initial story took as it requires building up a large amount of 10☆ equipment and high level enchantments.
With these you can optimise your runs for quicker times and therefore faster loot attainment which will prepare you for new content as it's added to the game.
</answer>

▶ Is there a mobile/Switch version?
<answer>
Currently not. However, both mobile and Switch versions are planned for 2020.

·:·:· Basic Gameplay ·:·:·


▶ What’s the best set of weapons?
<answer>
SSRPG has a strong focus on using the right weapons for the right job. 
As you progress you’ll have different priorities that dictate which equipment best solves your needs at the time.
</answer>

▶ No, for real though, what are the best weapons?
<answer>
Big swords are effective against mobs and small swords have the highest DPS, while shields and hammers are great for stacking up armor.
</answer>

▶ What’s an Æther foe?
<answer>
Æther is an element. 
There are 5 elements in the game: Poison (∞), Vigor (♥), Æther (*), Fire (φ) and Ice (❄). 
Most enemies have an element associated with them and you can use the Sight Stone’s equipped ability to inspect enemies and learn about their type and weakness.
</answer>

▶ What does Unmake mean?
<answer>
To be unmade is to evaporate into pure Ki. 
Some Æther weapons have a special ability that can instantly unmake foes. 
This usually does not work on bosses.
</answer>

▶ How do I get more wands? / How do I get more [element] runes?
<answer>
Each area has an element associated with it which will cause that element's rune to drop.
  Poison (∞) in the caustic caves and Temple
  Vigor  (♥) in the Mushroom Forest
  Æther  (*) in the Haunted Halls
  Fire   (φ) in the Bronze Mines
  Ice    (❄) in the Icy Ridge
The final boss can drop any of the elemental runes.

The exception to this however is the Deadwood Canyon, instead of a rune it drops increased amounts basic equipments and especially wands 
</answer>

▶ Is there a faster way to craft stuff? Getting past 5☆ takes too long.
<answer>
The best way to craft higher star equipment is to combine the base items up to the star level you want and then fuse those into the final item you want.

Example:    
  sword + 63 swords = 6☆ sword
  wand + 63 wands = 6☆ wand
  6☆ sword + 6☆ wand = 6☆ stone sword 
</answer>

▶ What does the Quest Stone do? 
<answer>
The Quest Stone isn’t fully implemented yet. It’s planned to allow user generated side-quests. 
In the meantime, it’s just a good way to supplement the passive armor generation of shields, as it can be equipped on either hand.
</answer>

▶ What does mutate do?
<answer>
Mutating items changes something about them.
A weapon with a rune slotted changes which suffix it has, dP > D for example.
A base weapon like a sword will turn into another base item, E.G.  a wand into a shield.
A rune on its own, not slotted into anything, will turn into another type of rune. poison(∞) > ice(❄). etc.

The result from the mutation is randomised

▶ What is Stonescript?
<answer>
Stonescript is an optional, late-game addition that unlocks when you find the Mind Stone. 
It allows you to write scripts that further automate your character, such as drinking potions if your health gets low. 
The most common use is to change weapons based on changing conditions in the game. 
For example, when you face a specific boss you can automatically equip the best gear against it. 
It also allows you to overlay custom ASCII art over the game (cosmetics). Maybe Pallas needs a hat or Bolesh needs some booties? 
Version 3.0 of the game expands Stone Story with a broad range of new functionality that allows players to get extra creative.
</answer>

▶ Programming? That sounds hard…
<answer>
Strictly speaking, Stonescript is optional, though recommended. 
There is nothing stopping you from beating the game without it. 
However, if you are interested in giving it a go there are a bunch of helpful people willing to lend a hand over on the SSRPG Discord Server. 
[ <a href="https://discord.gg/StoneStoryRPG" target="_blank">https://discord.gg/StoneStoryRPG</a> ]
</answer>

▶ What are some good starting tips for Stonescript?
<answer>
Hold Tab for more information in-level.
‘foe = boss’ is a good catch all for the bosses.
Check out <a href="http://stonestoryrpg.com/stonescript/help.txt" target="_blank">http://stonestoryrpg.com/stonescript/help.txt</a> for a comprehensive documentation of implemented Stonescript features.
you can also browse the Discord’s #stonescript channel and ask questions there if you get stuck.
